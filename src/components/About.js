      <h3>About Laura</h3>

      <p className="col-sm">
          Born in Louisiana, Laura spent much of her formative years coding basic websites on her Toshiba laptop during the panic of Y2K (on a dial-up connection). She eventually took a creative turn with her background in Psychology, originally interested in art therapy and how color perception affects behavior. With the desire to create, she obtained a degree in graphic design, enamored with Photosohop and layout design.
      <br></br><br></br>Her dual loves, technology and design, eventually crossed paths when she started building static sites and customizing WordPress CSS for clients. Just like that, she was hooked. She was thrilled to learn that web development can also be a creative field and has rigorously pursued it ever since. She specializes in front-end development, but has also experience in back-end (full-stack). When she's not on the computer, she enjoys cooking, watching movies, reading and sketching. <br></br>
